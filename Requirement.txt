Project Requirements:
1.  Must be a Git Merged Project
2.  3 Tier architecture API Project
3.  Must have the implementation of SOLID
4.  Each member must have at least 4 entity operations (not CRUD) and don't create entities with basic properties like name, id etc.
5.  Each member needs to implement features rather than CRUD to obtain good marks.
6.  Each member will be evaluated individually based on his/her work in the project so refrain from saying we worked together either by       sitting in a place or in video conference.
7.  Each member need to justify/defend his/her contribution towards the project.
